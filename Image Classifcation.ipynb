    "In this mini problem set, you will how to apply image classification to marine environments. Unlike typical object recognition tasks that recognize objects that have limited variability in form, content, and shape, marine image classification requires a system that can handle incredible variability in object form. Take the following images of sand and seaweed, for example:\n",

    "These images include a tangle of objects, variable colors, occlusion, and other issues that make typical object recognition inaccurate. Throughout this mini problem set, you will learn how to build better models and methods for dealing with unstructured environments such as those found in marine habitats. The goal is to create a system with a higher accuracy in recognizing parts of a marine habitat, which would come in handy during AUV surveying and planning."
