Possible answers for coral image:
Texture, Geology, Soil, Rock, Concrete

Google's answers are more specific for the horse image than for the coral one.

Answers may vary, but something along the lines of the answers below suffice:
A. It is possible that Google did not offer options for coral during the training process; therefore it was not one of the possible labels.
B. The images of coral that Google used to train looked nothing like the image that we provided (which was more similar to images of rocks and soil).
C. Google optimized their algorithm for the "common case" (people are more likely to ask for images about horses than underwater images of coral).

5.a. Saliency

def get_patch_entropy(log_probs):
	return -1*sum(log_probs)/len(log_probs)

a. As the number of times hue is included as a feature increases, the classification accuracy increases. Students might expect the function to be linear, exponential, quadratic, etc. but something *not* stepwise.

b. Sufficient answers include anything mentioning huge contrast between images of seaweed and images of sand.
