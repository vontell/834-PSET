Take the following images of sand and seaweed, for example:\n",

Throughout this mini problem set, you will learn how to build better models and methods for dealing with unstructured environments such as those found in marine habitats. The goal is to create a system with a higher accuracy in recognizing parts of a marine habitat, which would come in handy during AUV surveying and planning."

    "# 3. Finding Interest Point Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Interest point operators can help us find points or features in the image that are unique and tell us something about the picture as a whole. These features are often found on the edges and corners of the image because these boundary points separate out the foreground, where interesting features are, from the lighter image background. We will be exploring a technique called MSER in this mini problem set to find high contrast regions of the image which represent edges, and sample features from those points.\n",

    "We will explore the concept of thresholding, which is the idea that a threshold is set between 0 and 255 (the values that a pixel can be) and all the pixels above that number are white and all those below the number are black. In the code below, the function MSER takes in a threshold value. Then the display image (a picture of a horse) is read as a numpy array with dimensions 128x128 with pixel values between 0 and 255. Your task is to fill in the code in the area specified so that pixel values below the threshold are 0, which means they are black and pixel values above the threshold are 255, which means they are white. Your final image should be called 'final' in order to be properly displayed. You can check yourself by ensuring that your pictures at threshold levels 80, 100 and 120 look like the following pictures respectively.\n",

    "As explained in the introduction, color is an important feature in correctly classifying unstructured environments such as coral. In order to incorporate this data into our training / features, we add the average hue of the patch to the feature vectors that are created using SIFT. The hue value can be visualized below, and is found by convering a pixel in RGB into the HSV color space.\n",

    "\n",
    "If we have a 128-dimension feature vector from SIFT representing a patch, then the new feature vector would be of dimension 129. However, a trick/hack that we can employ is to copy the hue value into the feature vector multiple times. By adding, say, 10 more features which each hold the hue data, we may be able to achieve higher classification accuracies.\n",
