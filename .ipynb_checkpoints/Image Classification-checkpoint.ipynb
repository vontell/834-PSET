    "\n",
    "Interest point operators can help us find points or features in the image that are unique and tell us something about the picture as a whole. These features are often found on the edges and corners of the image because these boundary points separate out the foreground, where interesting features are, from the lighter image background. We will be exploring a technique called MSER in this mini problem set to find high contrast regions of the image which represent edges, and sample features from those points.\n",

    "We will explore the concept of thresholding, which is the idea that a threshold is set between 0 and 255 (the values that a pixel can be) and all the pixels above that number are white and all those below the number are black. In the code below, the function MSER takes in a threshold value. Then the display image (a picture of a horse) is read as a numpy array with dimensions 128x128 with pixel values between 0 and 255. Your task is to fill in the code in the area specified so that pixel values below the threshold are 0, which means they are black and pixel values above the threshold are 255, which means they are white. Your final image should be called 'final' in order to be properly displayed. You can check yourself by ensuring that your pictures at threshold levels 80, 100 and 120 look like the following pictures respectively.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that we have gone through the process of obtaining feature vectors for our training images and classifying test images against this data, we can begin to make adjustments for handling unstructured environments. As covered in the lecture, two useful extensions are the use of saliency and hue information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### a. Saliency\n",
    "Recall from the lecture that saliency is a measure of entropy used to determine how \"interesting\" a patch is. We can use this to select regions of images that are better for training. Recall that the entropy for a discrete random variable is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E(\\Delta I)=H=-\\sum_{i=1}^{n}p(x_{i})\\log p(x_{i})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the gray scale image we define the probability $p(x)$ as follows,\n",

    "$$p(x_{i})={h(x_{i\\over N})={1\\over N}\\sum_{j=1}^{N}\\delta(x_{i}-x_{j})}$$\n",

    "$$\\delta(x)=\\cases{1, x=0\\cr 0, x\\neq 0 } $$\n",

    "So finally the entropy of a patch with $N_p$ pixels will be:\n",
    "$$H_{g}=-{1\\over N_{p}}\\sum_{j=1}^{N_{p}}\\log p_{g}(x_{j}) $$\n",
    "It is important to note that we are calculating the log probability, $p_{g}$ using all the pixels in the image, but the outermost sum is just over the pixels in the patch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the function below which returns the total entropy for a given patch. The parameter `log_probs` is a list of values which represents the log probability of each pixel based off the global distribution of pixels.\n",

In order to incorporate this data into our training / features, we add the average hue of the patch to the feature vectors that are created using SIFT. The hue value can be visualized below, and is found by convering a pixel in RGB into the HSV color space.\n",

    "\n",
    "If we have a 128-dimension feature vector from SIFT representing a patch, then the new feature vector would be of dimension 129. However, a trick/hack that we can employ is to copy the hue value into the feature vector multiple times. By adding, say, 10 more features which each hold the hue data, we may be able to achieve higher classification accuracies.\n",
